# FreeCol Mod
This is a [FreeCol](http://www.freecol.org/) Mod. FreeCol is a turn-based strategy game based on the old game Colonization, and similar to Civilization. The objective of the game is to create an independent nation. You start with only a few colonists defying the stormy seas in their search for new land.

# Enhanced Scouts
This mod improves the abilities of the seasoned scouts. By default FreeCol/Colonization's only benefit to having a seasoned scout is to improve rumor chances. This mod also gives the seasoned scout extended sight radius, and additional movement capabilities, thus making the seasoned scout a more valuable unit to use for exploration of the new world.
